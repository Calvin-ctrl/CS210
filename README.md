# CS210- Data Science and Machine Learning Algorithm

In our project, we will be working on the Google Play Store and Apple Store datasets. The goal of the project is to analyze each category of applications and determine whether a certain category is more successful in Play Store or Apple Store. Considering that app developers often prioritize an operating system, for example Android vs. iOS, we plan to recommend a store to focus on, depending on which category the developer's app is in, so that the developer may have more probability success.
